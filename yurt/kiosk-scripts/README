 The scripts in this directory are meant to be run on the kiosk
 machine, to manage the Scalable calibration data for the five
 projection screens that make up the YURT.  They are to work with the
 Cygwin environment on the kiosk machine, thus all the references to
 /cygdrive/z and /cygdrive/z and so forth.
